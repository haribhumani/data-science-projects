I have taken movies dataset where it contains more than 35,000+ movie sysnopses for this project. The agenda of this project is to identify the correlated movies. When a movie author/user wants to know the movie title but don't remember the movie name or to know if there exists a similar movie w.r.t to his ideas or thoughts, he/she can submit a query and find the most correlated movies with his query. Also, it dislplays the matching context, movie title and the matching score. This project helps in preventing the copyright or forgery issues for movie authors by feeding their ideas before producing the movies. 

Ex: I have the input query as "maverick trained the pilots for a mission", a small theme which is from the recent movie called "Top Gun". The model predicts the movie matching content, their titles and the similarity scores.
